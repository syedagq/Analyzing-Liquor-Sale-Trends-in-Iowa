# 1. Executive Summary 

The 'Iowa Liquor Retail Sales' dataset, sourced by the Iowa Department of Commerce and extracted from BigQuery, provides detailed insights on the state's liquor sales. In this notebook, we explore the dataset with the aim of providing insights that are useful for both consumers and retailers. Our goal is to help retailers address key supply chain concerns such as incorrect forecasting and recognition of demand constraints.

We have conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset, which is divided into four topics:

* ***Topic 1: Trends in liquor sales from 2012 to the present***
* ***Topic 2: Analysis of liquor sales by count and profit***
* ***Topic 3: Forecasting liquor demand based on historical data***
* ***Topic 4: Understanding vendor and retail store data***

Through our EDA, we hope to decipher patterns and relationships that will aid in the effective management of liquor sales in Iowa. Our visualizations and explorations are designed to be insightful and informative, providing a foundation for future analysis and decision-making.

Additionally, we have undergone machine learning to predict the volume sold in the incoming months, for which we have run a Linear Regression based model. The benefit of this is for retailers to be able to have a realistic idea of what to expect, optimise their supply chain decisions and ensure that resources are allocated efficiently.
